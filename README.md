# Three.js - A JavaScript 3D library, repackaged for Meteor.

This is a simple Meteor package for including Three.js in a Meteor project using the Meteor package manager. Because Three.js contains several useful featuers hidden away in the examples folder I've included a couple of extra files that I use frequently along with the main Three.js.

For extra info on Three.js or Meteor please refer to their respective homepages:

[Three.js](http://threejs.org)

[Meteor](http://meteor.com)

## How to install 
Like any other Meteor package you can simply run the following from the command line: 

`meteor add limemakers:three`

## Notes
I'll try to keep this package up to date with each Three.js release. If you use this package and want me to add in any other files from the examples folder, send me a message and I'll update this package to include it.
